# Analysis of Global Terrorism
Aylin Kosar


## Introduction

Global Terrorism affects our world today and is many times portrayed with a misunderstanding of why it occurs. Whenever we hear of a terrorist attack, the news media always dramatizes it to be a larger issue than it really is especially when our country has a big issue with gun violence. Terrorism looks terrible now because of the expanded methods on harming people and the new technology that has arose. However, the ideology and the actual tactics that the group or individual deploys is still the same. I would like to see when the terrroist attacks occurs the most and at where it occurs.  


## Data 

The data was used was from the National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism (START). The same data set made public can be found in this Kaggle page https://www.kaggle.com/ecodan/global-terrorism-db/home. The data set contains **181691** observations and **135** variables. Eventually, the data was preprocessed to **121** variables.
